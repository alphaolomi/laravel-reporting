# Comparison of PDF Generation Libraries

Certainly, here's a table summarizing the comparisons between DomPDF, Snappy (wkhtmltopdf), FPDF, and Browsershot:

| Library          | Primary Use Case                      | Features and Capabilities                    | Complexity | Control      | Integration   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| DomPDF           | Convert HTML/CSS to PDF               | Supports modern CSS, complex layouts        | Moderate   | Limited      | Standalone    |
| Snappy (wkhtmltopdf) | Convert HTML/CSS to PDF           | WebKit rendering, JavaScript support         | Moderate   | High         | Standalone    |
| FPDF             | Create PDFs programmatically          | Full control over PDF content and layout     | Low        | High         | Standalone    |
| Browsershot      | Capture web page screenshots/PDFs     | Screenshot capture, simplicity              | Low        | Limited      | Laravel-based |


### Please note that the 

- "Complexity" rating refers to how difficult or complex it is to use the library, with "Low" being easier and "High" being more complex. 
- "Control" refers to the level of control you have over the PDF generation process, with "Limited" meaning less control and "High" meaning more control. 
- "Integration" indicates whether the library has specific integration options with frameworks like Laravel (in the case of Browsershot).
